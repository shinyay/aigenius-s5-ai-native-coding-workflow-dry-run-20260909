## "Code with AI: GitHub Copilot for AI-Native Coding Workflows"

Welcome! This is the hands-on workshop repo for **AI Genius Episode 1**. You'll work through the full AI-native development loop: writing issues, delegating to Copilot, reviewing generated code, and iterating via PR comments.

---

## What You Will Learn

- What "AI Native" actually means for developers
- How to write issues that give Copilot the context it needs
- How to assign work to Copilot and observe it in action
- How to review Copilot-generated PRs like a senior developer
- How to iterate via PR comments instead of starting from scratch
- Best practices for collaborating with AI throughout the coding process
- In the optional exercise, how to review changes involving cloud SDKs and credentials with safety in mind

## The AI-Native Workflow Loop

```
IDEA
  └─► GitHub Issue  (describe the work)
        └─► Assign to Copilot  (Copilot agent picks it up)
              └─► Work runs in a restricted temporary environment
                    │   (effective access depends on configuration)
                    └─► Draft PR is opened  (summary + View session)
                          └─► Human reviews and iterates via PR comments
                                └─► Merge and ship
```

You are the **tech lead** in this workflow. Copilot handles the *how*. You define the *what* and *why*.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with access to GitHub Copilot
- [GitHub Copilot App](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/quickstart-copilot-app) installed and signed in
- Python 3.10+ installed locally (for the starter app)
- Git installed

### Get Started

1. **Fork this repo** to your own GitHub account (top-right corner of this page).

2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aigenius-s5-ai-native-coding-workflow.git
   cd aigenius-s5-ai-native-coding-workflow
   ```

3. **Run the starter app**:
   ```bash
   cd starter-app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py add "Deploy the API" --priority high --due 2025-12-31 --tag work
   python app.py add "Buy coffee" --priority low --tag personal
   python app.py list
   python app.py search "deploy"
   python app.py stats
   ```

4. **Open the GitHub Copilot App** and connect it to your forked repo.

5. Complete core Exercises 01–04 in order, starting with [`exercises/01-write-an-issue`](./exercises/01-write-an-issue/README.md). After completing the core workflow, optionally continue to [Optional Exercise 05](./exercises/05-azure-and-ai/README.md) for Azure and AI practice.

## Present the Slides in GitHub Copilot App

The repository includes a project Canvas extension that presents the AI Genius S5E1 slide images without switching to PowerPoint.

1. Open this repository in GitHub Copilot App.
2. Start a session after project extensions have loaded.
3. Ask Copilot: `Open the AI Genius Slide Presenter canvas.`
4. Use the on-screen controls, thumbnails, or keyboard shortcuts to present.

The viewer supports previous/next navigation, direct thumbnail selection, slide numbers, and fullscreen. If the host does not allow the browser Fullscreen API, it uses an in-Canvas presentation mode instead.

See [`presentation/ai-genius-s5e1`](./presentation/ai-genius-s5e1/README.md) for controls and slide update instructions.

## Explore the Copilot App Developer Experience

The [bilingual HTML DX guide](./presentation/copilot-app-dx/README.md) explains the central message, six changes in developer experience, product roles, and a review-and-iteration framework for making acceptance decisions. Use its **日本語 / English** toggle to switch the content, diagrams, prompts, and exercise links. It is a self-contained, scroll-based artifact that can be opened locally or in a **Browser Canvas**, independently of the slide presenter.

## Companion: Delegate PR finishing with Agent Merge

The [bilingual Agent Merge guide](./presentation/copilot-app-agent-merge/README.md) explains the feature, app workflow, use cases, and conditions people set through CSS/SVG diagrams and five fictional PR simulations. It is a single-file HTML artifact with no runtime network access or real PR operations. This independent companion introduces a further option without changing the core exercises' human-operated merge workflow.

## Exercise Flow

| Track | Exercise | What you will learn |
|---|---|---|
| Core | [Exercise 01](./exercises/01-write-an-issue/README.md) | Write a problem statement, desired behavior, acceptance criteria, constraints, and Definition of Done that an agent can implement |
| Core | [Exercise 02](./exercises/02-assign-to-copilot/README.md) | Delegate an issue to Copilot and observe its investigation, implementation, and testing |
| Core | [Exercise 03](./exercises/03-review-a-pr/README.md) | Review a generated PR for correctness, quality, security, dependencies, and test effectiveness |
| Core | [Exercise 04](./exercises/04-iterate/README.md) | Request improvements through precise PR comments, re-review the result, and merge manually |
| Optional | [Optional Exercise 05](./exercises/05-azure-and-ai/README.md) | Extend the completed workflow to Azure Table Storage and Azure OpenAI scenarios |

Completing Exercises 01–04 completes the workshop's core learning path. Optional Exercise 05 is an additional cloud-and-AI challenge for learners who want to continue.

Exercise 01 includes Azure-based Options A and B. Choose Option C or D for a core path that does not require Azure access; Options A and B require an appropriate Azure environment and can be deferred to Optional Exercise 05.

## The 5 Golden Rules of AI-Native Coding

1. **Write better issues** -- your issue IS your prompt. Be specific.
2. **Review like a senior dev** -- AI generates fast, humans verify smart.
3. **Use `copilot-instructions.md`** -- give Copilot standing context about your project.
4. **Iterate, don't regenerate** -- guide via comments rather than starting from scratch.
5. **Stay in the loop** -- check the session log, understand what Copilot did and why.
