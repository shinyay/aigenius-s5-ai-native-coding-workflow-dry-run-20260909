# Optional Exercise 05 -- Azure + AI: The Cloud-Native Extension

English | [日本語](README.ja.md)

> [!NOTE]
> **This is an optional extension for learners who have completed Exercises 01–04.** Those four exercises complete the workshop's core AI-native development loop. Exercise 05 is not required to complete the workshop; use it when you want additional practice with cloud SDKs, external AI services, secrets, failure handling, and mocked tests. You may complete either option or both, depending on your goals and available Azure environment.

## Goal

See how Copilot handles real cloud SDK integration and AI feature development — and understand what makes these tasks both impressive and risky to delegate.

## Why This Is Different

In the previous exercises, Copilot extended a local Python app. Now you'll write issues that require Copilot to:

- Use the **Azure SDK** for cloud storage (`azure-data-tables`)
- Call **Azure OpenAI** to add AI behaviour at runtime
- Handle secrets safely using environment variables
- Write tests that mock cloud calls

This is a meaningful complexity jump. It's also where the quality of your issue and your review skills matter most.

## Option 1: Migrate Storage to Azure Table Storage

### The Architecture

```
CLI (app.py)
    └─► storage.py  (new abstraction layer)
            ├─► LocalStorage (current JSON file — default)
            └─► AzureTableStorage (new — activated by env var)
```

When `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is set, the app uses Azure Table Storage. Otherwise it falls back to the local JSON file. **Zero breaking changes.**

### Pre-Written Issue

If you already implemented Option A during Exercise 01, this option is complete; use Option 2 only if you want additional AI practice. Otherwise, if you choose Option 1, create a new issue with this content:

**Title:** Migrate task storage to Azure Table Storage

**Problem statement:**
Tasks are currently stored in a local JSON file (`tasks.json`). This means data is lost when the machine changes and cannot be shared across devices. We need a cloud-backed storage option.

**Desired behaviour:**
- When the `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is set, tasks are stored in and retrieved from an Azure Table Storage table named `tasks`.
- When the environment variable is not set, the app falls back to the existing local JSON file behaviour.
- All existing CLI commands (`add`, `list`, `complete`, `edit`, `delete`, `stats`) work identically regardless of which storage backend is active.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] A new `storage.py` module defines a `TaskStorage` protocol with `load() -> list[dict]` and `save(tasks: list[dict]) -> None` methods
- [ ] `LocalStorage` implements `TaskStorage` using the existing JSON file approach
- [ ] `AzureTableStorage` implements `TaskStorage` using `azure-data-tables`
- [ ] `app.py` calls `get_storage()` to obtain the correct implementation at startup
- [ ] `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is loaded from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv` if present
- [ ] If the env var is set but the connection fails, the app prints a clear error and exits with code 1
- [ ] `azure-data-tables` and `python-dotenv` are added to `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Tests cover both storage implementations (mock Azure calls with `unittest.mock`)
- [ ] No connection strings or account keys appear in source code

**Constraints:**
- Use `azure-data-tables` (not the older `azure-storage-table` SDK)
- Use `PartitionKey = "tasks"` and `RowKey = str(task["id"])` for Azure entities
- Do not change the CLI interface or task schema

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] `python app.py add "Test" && python app.py list` works with a real Azure Storage account
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New tests cover `AzureTableStorage` with mocked Azure calls

### What to Look for in the PR

When reviewing Copilot's implementation, pay particular attention to:

- **Does it hardcode any credentials?** This is a critical security failure if so.
- **Does the storage abstraction actually decouple the two implementations?** Or did it inline everything in `app.py`?
- **Are Azure errors handled gracefully?** Or do they produce raw Python stack traces?
- **Are the tests actually isolated?** Azure calls must be mocked — not real.

## Option 2: Add Azure OpenAI Task Categorisation

### The Architecture

```
python app.py add "Renew SSL certificate"
    └─► Azure OpenAI: "Suggest a category for: Renew SSL certificate"
            └─► returns: "devops"
                    └─► task saved with tags: ["devops"]
```

### Pre-Written Issue

If you already implemented Option B during Exercise 01, this option is complete; use Option 1 only if you want additional cloud practice. Otherwise, if you choose Option 2, create a new issue with this content:

**Title:** Add Azure OpenAI smart tag suggestion to `add` command

**Problem statement:**
Users often forget to tag tasks when adding them. We want to use Azure OpenAI to suggest a single category tag automatically when no tags are provided.

**Desired behaviour:**
- When `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`, and `OPENAI_API_VERSION` are all set AND the user does not provide any `--tag` arguments, call Azure OpenAI to suggest a single tag for the task.
- The suggested tag is added automatically and displayed to the user: `[AI suggested tag: devops]`
- If any of the env vars are missing, or if the AI call fails, the task is saved without a tag (graceful degradation — never block the user).
- Add a `--no-ai` flag to `add` that skips the AI suggestion entirely.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `suggest_tag(task_name: str, description: str) -> str | None` function in a new `ai.py` module
- [ ] Uses `openai.AzureOpenAI` with credentials and `api_version` from environment variables, and passes `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` as the deployment or request model
- [ ] System prompt instructs the model to return a single lowercase tag (no punctuation)
- [ ] `add` command calls `suggest_tag` only when no `--tag` flags are provided and `--no-ai` is not set
- [ ] Graceful degradation: any exception from the AI call is caught and logged, task is saved normally
- [ ] `openai` added to `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Tests for `suggest_tag` mock the OpenAI client — no real API calls in tests
- [ ] Tests verify the timeout and retry configuration

**Constraints:**
- Configure a five-second request timeout and disable automatic retries to limit waiting (`timeout=5`, `max_retries=0`)
- Never log or print the raw API key
- The `--no-ai` flag is documented in `--help`

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] `python app.py add "Deploy to production"` with env vars set shows an AI-suggested tag
- [ ] `python app.py add "Deploy" --no-ai` skips the AI call
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New tests cover `suggest_tag` with mocked responses and error cases

---

### What to Look for in the PR

- **Is the AI call truly optional?** The app must work even when the env vars are not set.
- **Is waiting bounded by explicit client settings?** Verify the five-second request timeout and disabled automatic retries; these settings limit network waiting but are not a strict end-to-end wall-clock deadline.
- **Is the prompt well-designed?** Ask Copilot to show you the system prompt — does it constrain the output format clearly?
- **Are errors swallowed silently?** Errors should be caught and logged, not silently ignored.
- **Is the data sent to Azure OpenAI clear and appropriate?** The task name and description may contain sensitive information, so verify exactly which fields leave the local machine and ensure prompts and logs do not expose secrets.

## Optional Stretch Goal: Complete the Cloud + AI Extensions

If you want to keep extending the app, choose a path based on the Exercise 01 option you completed:

- If you completed Option A, continue with Option 2 (Azure OpenAI).
- If you completed Option B, implement Option 1 (Azure Table Storage).
- If you completed Option C or D, choose either Option 1 or Option 2. Complete both only if you want the full cloud-and-AI extension.

For each remaining option, run the complete AI-native loop: write the issue, assign it to Copilot, review the PR, iterate through feedback, and merge according to your repository rules.

If you complete both options, you'll have an app that:
- Stores tasks in Azure Table Storage
- Auto-categorises tasks with AI on creation
- Has a full test suite with mocked cloud calls
- Loads all credentials from environment variables
